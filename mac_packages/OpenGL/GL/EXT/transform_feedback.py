'''OpenGL extension EXT.transform_feedback

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.EXT.transform_feedback to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	This extension provides a new mode to the GL, called transform feedback,
	which records selected vertex attributes for each primitive processed by
	the GL.  The selected attributes are written into buffer objects, and can
	be written with each attribute in a separate buffer object or with all
	attributes interleaved into a single buffer object.  If a geometry shader
	is active, the primitives recorded are those emitted by the geometry
	shader.  Otherwise, transform feedback captures primitives whose vertices
	are transformed by a vertex shader.  In either case, the primitives
	captured are those generated prior to clipping.  Transform feedback mode
	captures the values of specified varying variables emitted from GLSL
	vertex or geometry shaders.
	
	The vertex data recorded in transform feedback mode is stored into buffer
	objects as an array of vertex attributes.  The regular representation and
	the use of buffer objects allows the recorded data to be processed
	directly by the GL without requiring CPU intervention to copy data.  In
	particular, transform feedback data can be used for vertex arrays (via
	vertex buffer objects), as the source for pixel data (via pixel buffer
	objects), as shader constant data (via the NV_parameter_buffer_object or
	EXT_bindable_uniform extensions), or via any other extension that makes
	use of buffer objects.
	
	This extension introduces new query object support to allow transform
	feedback mode to operate asynchronously.  Query objects allow applications
	to determine when transform feedback results are complete, as well as the
	number of primitives processed and written back to buffer objects while in
	transform feedback mode.  This extension also provides a new rasterizer
	discard enable, which allows applications to use transform feedback to
	capture vertex attributes without rendering anything.
