'''OpenGL extension NV.bindless_texture

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.NV.bindless_texture to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	This extension allows OpenGL applications to access texture objects in
	shaders without first binding each texture to one of a limited number of
	texture image units.  Using this extension, an application can query a
	64-bit unsigned integer texture handle for each texture that it wants to
	access and then use that handle directly in GLSL or assembly-based
	shaders.  The ability to access textures without having to bind and/or
	re-bind them is similar to the capability provided by the
	NV_shader_buffer_load extension that allows shaders to access buffer
	objects without binding them.  In both cases, these extensions
	significantly reduce the amount of API and internal GL driver overhead
	needed to manage resource bindings.
	
	This extension also provides similar capability for the image load, store,
	and atomic functionality provided by OpenGL 4.2, OpenGL ES 3.1 and the
	ARB_shader_image_load_store and EXT_shader_image_load_store extensions,
	where a texture can be accessed without first binding it to an image unit.
	An image handle can be extracted from a texture object using an API with a
	set of parameters similar to those for BindImageTextureEXT.
	
	This extension adds no new data types to GLSL.  Instead, it uses existing
	sampler and image data types and allows them to be populated with texture
	and image handles.  This extension does permit sampler and image data
	types to be used in more contexts than in unextended GLSL 4.00.  In
	particular, sampler and image types may be used as shader inputs/outputs,
	temporary variables, and uniform block members, and may be assigned to by
	shader code.  Constructors are provided to convert 64-bit unsigned integer
	values to and from sampler and image data types.  Additionally, new APIs
	are provided to load values for sampler and image uniforms with 64-bit
	handle inputs.  The use of existing integer-based Uniform* APIs is still
	permitted, in which case the integer specified will identify a texture
	image or image unit.  For samplers and images with values specified as
	texture image or image units, the GL implemenation will translate the unit
	number to an internal handle as required.
	
	To access texture or image resources using handles, the handles must first
	be made resident.  Accessing a texture or image by handle without first
	making it resident can result in undefined results, including program
	termination.  Since the amount of texture memory required by an
	application may exceed the amount of memory available to the system, this
	extension provides API calls allowing applications to manage overall
	texture memory consumption by making a texture resident and non-resident
	as required.
