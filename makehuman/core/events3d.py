class EventHandler(object):
    """
    Base event handler class. Derive from this class if an object needs to be able to have events attached to it.
    Currently only one event per event name can be attached. This is because we either allow a class method or
    a custom method to be attached as event handling method. Since the custom method replaces the class method,
    it is needed in some case to call the base class's method from the event handling method.

    There are 2 ways to attach handlers:

    1. Override the method. This is the most appropriate way when you want to add distinctive behaviour to many EventHandlers.

    ::

        class Widget(View):

            def onMouseDown(self, event):
                #Handle event

    2. Use the event decorator. This is the most appropriate way when you want to attach distinctive behaviour to one EventHandler.

    ::

        widget = Widget()

        @widget.mhEvent:
        def onMouseDown(event):
            #Handle event

    Note that self is not passed to the handler in this case, which should not be a problem as you can just use the variable since you are creating a closure.
